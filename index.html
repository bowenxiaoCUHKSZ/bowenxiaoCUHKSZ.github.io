	<p>
	I'm Revan, a third-year undergraduate at Rutgers University.
	</p>
	<p>
	I have experience <a href="/work">in industry</a> and <a href="/research">in research</a>, which means I can bring you organized software
	<br>or sharp technical writing, depending which side of that split you fall on.
	</p>
	<p>
	I like <a href="/projects">building things</a> at hackathons.
	Sometimes, <a href="/blog">I write words</a> for fun, too.
	</p>

	<p>
	Check me out on <a href="https://github.com/revan">GitHub</a>
