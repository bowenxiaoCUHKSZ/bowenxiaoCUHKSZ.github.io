title: "Peruse is Dead"
---
While I'm no fan of redundant made-up words, it's fine as long as you can understand the meaning.
Take ["irregardless"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irregardless), for example, a blend of "irrespective" and "regardless".
The "ir-" prefix and "-less" suffix form a double negative, so the word really should mean the opposite of "regardless", but everyone will understand.
Maybe they'll look at you funny, but your message would not be lost; the fact that some find it distasteful doesn't change the fact that the English language is alive and evolving, so malformations like this can be absorbed.

The word "peruse", formally defined as

> peruse - _(verb)_ - read (something), typically in a thorough or careful way.

has come to be used to mean literally the exact opposite, used to mean "read something in a shallow way".

Until the far-off day when the original definition fades in time, it can viably mean [two completely opposite things](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/peruse), thus requiring additional adjectives Ã  la "quick perusal", voiding any benefit the word had over the simple "read".

Peruse is dead.
