title: "Claiming an Inactive GitHub Account"
---

I recently found out that GitHub has a [Name Squatting Policy](https://help.github.com/articles/name-squatting-policy) whereby inactive accounts will be removed upon request.
This means that nice short handle someone claimed years ago and never used could be yours, assuming the account doesn't have loads of private activity.

###Considerations
After changing my account name, I had to update my domain settings to properly point to this website (hosted through github pages), and update the github pages repository to regenerate under this address.

URL's to your repositories will be properly forwarded, but your old account page will not forward to the new one. Remember to update any public references!
