  In the Governor's School program, a bunch of talented high school juniors are housed on campus for an intense month of
  courses, company tours, and independent research.
  <br>I worked as a research mentor in conjunction with the Ph.D.'s
  from Dynawheel, guiding four students in the design and implementation of smartphone games for stroke rehabilitation.
  <br>I myself had gone through the Governor's School program a few years prior, where I first learned about Android
  development, so mentoring was a pretty cool experience.
