    This research focus on leveraging payment channel and blockchain in a source sharing system. By deploying a payment channel 
    in public train, we build a web server acting as a intermediate role in connecting off-line agreement. Results show that our system
    outperform than normal blockchain based method. This paper is published at a top conference (2019 IEEE INFOCOM IECCO WRKSHP).
