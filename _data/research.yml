  description: "
    This research focus on leveraging payment channel and blockchain in a source sharing edge computing system. By deploying a payment channel 
    in public chain, I built a web server acting as a intermediate role in connecting off-line payment agreement. Results show that our system
    outperform than normal blockchain based method. This paper is published at a top network conference (2019 IEEE INFOCOM IECCO WRKSHP). Responsible
    for coding implementation, experimentation and paper writing.

    This research leverage blockchain in cloud education system. Different from traditional cloud, our system adopts three layer
    blockchain (public chain, consortium chain, private chain) to ensure throughput and data veracity. Mainly responsible for some basic experimentation
    and paper writing.
